## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v16.4.2 or higher
npm@7.18.1 or higher
git@2.30.1 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ‚òùÔ∏è

```
yarn@v1.22.10 or higher
```

---

## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone recipe-box:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mahmoudzanoun13/recipe-box

# Move into the repository
$ cd recipe-box

# Remove the current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.

Using NPM: Simply run the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the development server
$ npm start
```

Using Yarn: Be aware of that you'll need to delete the `package-lock.json` file before executing the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the development server
$ yarn start
```

**NOTE**:
The categories feature won't work because I'm using an API from **[SPOONACULAR](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)** So, if you wanted to activate it just follow steps:

### Step 1

- Go to Spoonacular website and create an account
- Once you created it, Click on MY CONSOLE on the website
- Then click on Profile on the left side
- Then copy your API key
- Once you get it, create `.env` file inside your directory
- Inside your `.env` file write `REACT_APP_API_KEY=Your_API_KEY`

**Note**:
After you created `.env` file, make sure that you stopped your server and started it again to work.

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` to see the Application locally.
